        'I am a problem solver at heart. I love tackling uncertain state-of-the-art problems where I donâ€™t know if an answer even exists, let alone if I can find it. As a student, I am double majoring in computer science & math at Yale. I have a strong background in math and programming, specifically in number theory, probability & statistics, data structures & algorithms, distributed systems, and deep learning. Pure math and programming have always been two different fields where I can constantly challenge myself to struggle and think about cool problems.',
        'The only thing better than solving problems is doing it with friends or in a team. I love helping people solve problems as much as solving them myself. That is what fuels my interest in teaching/mentorship, product engineering, research for ethical AI & deep learning, and ethics/philosophy in tech & engineering. I hope to avoid "being smart in a narrow way", and I do my best to learn, build, and code with a focus on awareness and empathy. I hope to use my academic training and industry experience to improve my product-building empathy and intuition, expand my problem-solving skills, and develop the critical thinking and communication foundations needed to research and work in ethical AI and product engineering for social good and equity.',

I also enjoy playing tennis and swimming, as well as following both closely on the collegiate and professional level. Finally, I am a long-time pianist, and I love performing for anyone and anything.",
