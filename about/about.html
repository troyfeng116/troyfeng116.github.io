			My name is Troy Feng, and I am originally from Pawtucket, Rhode
			Island. 
			I am a student at Yale University studying Computer Science with
			focuses in AI, machine learning, statistics & data science, and
			philosophy.
			As an aspiring full-stack software engineer, I am familiar with
			various modern techniques on the front and back end; please find 
			my <a>resume</a> here.
			I also have a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge with 
			others, especially if it has to do with problem solving.
			In my free time, I enjoy music (I am a long-time pianist), playing 
			tennis, and watching sports (I'm a big Boston sports fan, and I 
			also love watching tennis and swimming).
